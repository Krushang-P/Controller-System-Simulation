# Controller-System-Simulation
Building Entry Controller System Simulation with QNX RTOS

1. Designed and implemented a two-door system using QNX RTOS.
2. Integrated card scanners, a weight scale, and a human guard switch into the system.
3. Developed a robust state machine to handle inputs, outputs, conditions/events, and system states.
4. Implemented the "des_display" program to provide real-time system status updates based on messages from the controller program.
5. Utilized QNX RTOS features to ensure real-time responsiveness and reliability.
6. Developed the "des_controller" program to operate the state machine, manage persistent data, and handle smooth state transitions.
7. Built the "des_inputs" program to simulate input events and prompt the user for inputs, ensuring error handling for illegal events.
8. Demonstrated the functionality of the system through screenshots showcasing various scenarios and its interaction with QNX RTOS.
